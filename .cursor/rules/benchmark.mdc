# Benchmark

In order to properly benchmark our implementation, we need to follow these steps:

1. Compile the server with `bun run build`.
2. Run the compilation with `./bun-redis-server`.
3. Run `redis-benchmark -t set,get -n 100000 -q`.
4. Note the output-
5. Check the [README.md](mdc:README.md) in the Benchmark section.
6. Compare the values.
7. If the performance has improved, override the results showcase.
8. If the performance has worsen, notify that we have made things worse and write an action plan to improve or revert the changes that we made to restore the performance losses.
