# Architecture

This project is created using Bun https://bun.sh

## Project structure

- `commands`: in this folder we will store all of the supported redis-like commands.
- `persistence`: in this folder we will tore all of the persistence related redis-like implementations.
- `protocol`: in this folder we will store all of the redis-like protocol related things, like for instance, our RESP parser.
- `store`: in this folder we will store all of the redis-like store implementations, for instance, our key-value store.
- `utils`: in this folder we will store everything that's related to utilities and libraries that we might need to implement in order to help us build our server.
- `tests`: in this folder we will create all of the necessary tests related to any of implementations of the redis-like server. Everything should be carefully tested and make sure that covers at least 99% of the cases.

## Code style

This project uses Biome.js https://biomejs.dev/ as the linter and the code formatter.
